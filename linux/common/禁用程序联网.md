You create a group that is never allowed to use the internet and start the program as a member of this group.

1.Create a group no-internet. Do not join this group

sudo addgroup no-internet

2.Add a rule to iptables that prevents all processes belonging to the group no-internet from using the network (use ip6tables to also prevent IPv6 traffic)

sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --gid-owner no-internet -j DROP



3.Execute sudo -g no-internet YOURCOMMAND instead of YOURCOMMAND.
You can easily write a wrapper script that uses sudo for you. You can get rid of the password prompt by adding
%sudo ALL=(:no-internet) NOPASSWD: ALL


or, something similar with sudo visudo
Use the iptables-save and iptables-restore to persist firewall rules.
